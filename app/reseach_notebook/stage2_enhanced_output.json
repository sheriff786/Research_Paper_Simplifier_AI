However, the adoption of GenAI\nin the construction industry, as with other innovations, is slow, and many of its applications\nthus far have been rather simplistic or failed to deliver a useful, credible output. There is\na limited understanding of how GenAI is adopted in current practice and its potential to\nimprove future practice in architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO).\nUsing a systematic literature review approach, this study aims to map the current issues\nin applying GenAI. The literature review initially identified 1013 peer-reviewed articles\nfrom ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science. The articles were further filtered based on\nspecific criteria, resulting in 28 articles being retained for thematic analysis.

Coupled with a considerable increase in administrative\nrequirements and expectations, the productivity of the industry suffers.\nThere has been an increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI), including GenAI, to\nimprove processes in the workplace [1]. Organisations face a dilemma in either adopting\na structured approach towards GenAI or other tools that elevate productivity.
