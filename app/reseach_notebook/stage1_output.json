However, the adoption of GenAI\nin the construction industry, as with other innovations, is slow, and many of its applications\nthus far have been rather simplistic or failed to deliver a useful, credible output. There is\na limited understanding of how GenAI is adopted in current practice and its potential to\nimprove future practice in architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO).\nUsing a systematic literature review approach, this study aims to map the current issues\nin applying GenAI. The literature review initially identified 1013 peer-reviewed articles\nfrom ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science. The articles were further filtered based on\nspecific criteria, resulting in 28 articles being retained for thematic analysis. The findings\nshow a cluster of patterns in which GenAI is being adopted and shows promise. The\ncore themes identified are as follows: (1) project brief, (2) architectural design, (3) building\ninformation modelling, (4) structural design, (5) construction and demolition, (6) operations,\nand (7) urban governance. A typical trend noted in the AECO industry has been training\nAI models that achieve quicker results, improve quality, and use fewer resources.\nKeywords: built environment; generative artificial intelligence; construction; AECO",
    "introduction": "Construction as an industry is notorious for its slow adoption of innovation. Despite\nusing computer-aided technologies for many decades in different stages of the project\nlifecycle, the industry is still slow in implementing cutting-edge technologies and remains\ntraditional in its ways of working. Coupled with a considerable increase in administrative\nrequirements and expectations, the productivity of the industry suffers.\nThere has been an increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI), including GenAI, to\nimprove processes in the workplace [1]. Organisations face a dilemma in either adopting\na structured approach towards GenAI or other tools that elevate productivity. Part of\nthe problem lies in how the construction industry is organised, unlike business models\nin other sectors, such as manufacturing, which make the most of digital technologies in\nlean production. Opportunities for the construction industry to follow suit are limited due\nto its project-based nature [2]. For instance, despite its advantages, building information\nmodelling (BIM) has taken decades to integrate into the core business models of major\nconstruction organisations. The BIM maturity level in the construction industry is also still\nrelatively low.\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/buildings15132270\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n2 of 19\nExplaining the attention given to GenAI’s role in the construction industry, Hallo and\nNguyen [3] postulate that its widespread use could lead to smart design and infrastructure,\nwhich promotes improvements and efficiency throughout the construction project lifecycle,\nfrom inception and design to bidding, financing, transportation, operation, and asset\nmanagement [4].\nCurrently, the GenAI literature in the AECO sector is predominantly occupied with\ndeveloping discipline-specific courses and how it could benefit education. Jelodar [5]\nhighlighted applications in construction practice, especially in maintenance and training\nareas. Liao et al. [6] highlighted the improved effectiveness of building structural design\nthrough GenAI. Structural designs show promising outcomes when a finite element model\nis provided to ChatGPT [7]. Finite element modelling involves complex computational\nanalysis for building design under various loading conditions [8]. It highlights the sophisti-\ncation of GenAI models to understand and analyse complex designs. The research on the\nadoption of GenAI in the AECO sector is progressing but remains fragmented.\nThis study provides a comprehensive review of the GenAI in the AECO sector. There\nis a lack of understanding as to how GenAI is currently used in the sector and its potential\nto improve future practice. The objective of this paper is to identify patterns of GenAI\napplications in the AECO sector by performing a thematic review of the published literature\nin the field of study. The review specifically addresses the following research question:\nwhat are the current and future applications of GenAI in the AECO sector?\nThis paper is structured into four sections. Section 1 is an introduction to the study.\nSection 2 provides an overview of the related terms used in the database search and runs\nthrough the literature screening and data extraction methods. Section 3 focuses on the\nfindings and patterns of themes and sub-themes of GenAI application. The discussion of\nthe coverage of GenAI in AECO industries is presented in the same section, narrating the\nhighlights from the literature. Section 4 presents the conclusions and limitations of the\nstudy. Section 5 presents future directions for research in this area.\n2. Systematic Literature Review Process\nAs adopted from Moher et al. [9], a step-by-step approach was utilised to perform a\nsystematic review to answer the research question on the adoption of GenAI in the AECO\nsector. The thematic literature review search process comprises four stages: (1) formulating\nsearch terms, (2) literature identification, (3) literature screening, and (4) data extraction.\nThe detailed literature search process is shown in Figure 1. The automated Systematic\nReview Accelerator tool (SRA) was used to expedite the processes in this research—see\nClark et al. [10].\n2.1. Search Terms: GenAI, RIBA, and NATSPEC Plans of Work and Government Soft Landing\nTo systematically develop the search query, key terms used in the AECO industry\nneed to be considered. Several design process maps or plans of work are used worldwide\nto guide project stakeholders through the building’s life cycle, including briefing, design,\nconstruction, handover, and operation and maintenance. In most countries, the process\nmaps are set by the professional institutes or bodies and may have different names to\nindicate different stages or parts of stages. The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA),\na global organisation driving excellence in the quality of the built environment, uses\nan eight-stage plan of work. More locally in Australia, National Building Specification\n(NATSPEC) developed a work plan to provide the project team with a road map for\npromoting consistency from one stage to the next, and to provide vital guidance to building\nprojects [11]. NATSPEC’s plan comprises seven stages, with some overlaps and similarities\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n3 of 19\nwith RIBA. To avoid missing out on key stages, both terms used by the RIBA and NATSPEC\nplans of work were adopted.\nFigure 1. The procedure for selecting the final articles for thematic review.\nWhile RIBA and NATSPEC plans of work set the stages of works, the role of digitali-\nsation, particularly building information modelling (BIM), is pivotal for the construction\nindustry, especially in the transition of information from one stage to another [12]. The\nliterature identifies the potential for construction organisations to benefit from the integra-\ntion of GenAI and BIM, such as in project planning [13], structural design [14], and cost\nplanning and budgeting [15]. Therefore, searching the databases using BIM-specific terms\nin the AECO’s work stages is essential. In addition, the UK Government Soft Landing (GSL)\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n4 of 19\nframework is also adopted to offer essential insights into key stages. GSL emphasises BIM\nin maintaining the “golden thread” of information throughout the facility’s lifecycle [16].\nGSL complements the existing plans of work used in the construction industry. GSL offers\na smooth transition from construction to handover and project close out, and to facility\noperation, referred to as “soft landing”. GSL drives a structured and consistent approach\nfrom the outset of a project to its delivery. Thus, the terms used by GSL complement the\nkey terms used in RIBA and NATSPEC plans of work when exploring the use of GenAI in\nAECO (Table 1).\nTable 1.

Literature Identification\nThe cross-disciplinary databases on ProQuest, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of\nScience were searched on 20 November 2024. The search range was set to start in 2018,\nwhich was when OpenAI created the first version of the Generative Pretrained Transformer\n(GPT) [18]. The publications retrieved from these four databases cover topics such as the\npractice or adoption of GenAI technologies.\nCustomised search strategies (Keywords) have been constructed following a consulta-\ntion with Bond University’s academic librarian to avoid missing key studies due to poorly\nconstructed or improperly implemented searches. The search strategy comprises five main\nconcepts: population (population within the AECO industry), variable (Technologies),\nscope (Plan of work according to RIBA, NATSPEC and GSL), region (Australia), and time\nrange (2018–ongoing). The research string used in Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science is\nas follows:\n(GenAI OR “Generative AI” OR “Generative artificial intelligence” OR ChatGPT\nOR “Generative Pretrained Transformer” OR LLM OR “Large language model”) AND\nALL = (Lifecycle OR “Life cycle” OR Life-cycle OR Architecture OR Engineering OR\nConstruction OR Operation OR “Strategic definition” OR “Initial business case” OR “Prepa-\nration and briefing” OR Establishment OR “Final business case” OR “Concept design” OR\n“Schematic design” OR “Spatial coordination” OR “Technical design” OR “Design develop-\nment” OR “Contract documentation” OR Design OR “Manufacturing and construction”\nOR Handover OR “Pre-handover” OR Use OR “Facility management” OR “Operational\nstage”).\nIn Scopus and Web of Science, the initial search was refined to include only these\ndocument types: article, conference paper, review, book chapter, book, and editorial letters.\nIn ProQuest, the initial search was refined to include only these source types: journal\narticles, conference papers and proceedings, theses, dissertations, and working papers.\nThe study also would like to focus on the context of the Australian construction industry.\nHowever, due to a limited number of studies in this context, articles where at least one\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n5 of 19\nauthor was affiliated with an Australian institution were included instead. Table 2 presents\na classification of articles and the scope of the existing review studies related to GenAI\nin AECO.\n2.3. Literature Screening\nThe initial search results (n = 1107) were imported into the EndNote 21 software. The\nDeduplicator tool, part of the SRA, was used to find duplicates [19]. The resource list\nwas checked for duplicates manually to minimise the risk of deleting unique references\nand ensure no duplicates were missed by the automatic checker. A total of 94 duplicates\nwere deleted. Following their removal, the Screenatron tool on SRA was used to enable\nShoeb and Waled to screen the work individually. Then, the Disputatron tool on SRA\nwas used to automatically detect reviewer screening disagreements [10]. The title and\nabstract of the remaining 1013 records were reviewed for relevance to establish whether\nthey are fit for full text review using SRA. The excluded articles primarily discuss GenAI\nin education and other irrelevant application fields. This extensive screening process\neliminated 970 publications, resulting in 43 publications for further analysis.\nResearchers undertook a preliminary full-text content analysis of the 43 articles and\nassessed them against the eligibility criteria. The primary criterion for qualifying was that\nthe article must disclose an insight into the AECO industry’s perspectives on GenAI. After\nthe full text content analysis, 16 unrelated articles were removed, and 1 article was added\nfrom a general search over the internet by the research team based on relevance to the topic.\nIn total, 28 articles were retained for analysis.\n2.4. Data Extraction\nThe first layer of analysis of the 28 articles is presented in Table 2. It shows that\nmany reviews and empirical investigations have been undertaken to explore the recent\nadvancements in generative technologies. All 28 articles were examined in detail using\nNVIVO 14. The related GenAI applications in AECO were manually coded in the software,\nand relevant sections were extracted into the code. The patches of the literature were\nclassified into one or more themes (codes or clusters) using thematic analysis procedures\nproposed by Clarke & Braun [20]. Thematic analysis provides a comprehensive approach to\nidentify iteratively refining codes and their relationships in relation to GenAI in the AECO\nsector. It involves a cyclical process of coding, analysing, and then recoding based on the\nemerging insights and patterns within the data. This method deepens data understanding\nand ensures that the reported coding scheme is comprehensive and accurate.\nA total of seven themes were identified from the 28 articles: (1) project brief, (2) architec-\ntural design, (3) structural design, (4) BIM, (5) construction and demolition, (6) operations,\nand (7) urban governance. Under each theme, sub-theme levels are identified. Each article\nis classified under one or more of the seven identified themes as presented in Table 2. It\nhas been argued in the introduction that GenAI use has been fragmented and does not\npresent an organised approach in the construction sector. This is why the results present\nGenAI in different domains of the sector. Each theme identified presented a number of\ncoded statements from the literature, which suggests importance and application. Figure 2\ngraphically presents the thematic hierarchy chart of the seven themes and sub-level themes\nbased on the number of statements to support the themes. The sub-themes of each core\ntheme are displayed in Figures 3–9 in relevant sections.\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n6 of 19\nFigure 2. Thematic hierarchy chart based on coding in NVIVO 14.\nFigure 3.

Project Brief\nFigure 3 presents a thematic tree for the project brief, highlighting the role of GenAI\nin developing project briefs. GenAI has shown promising results in the early stages of a\nproject’s lifecycle—strategic definition and project brief stage. The design research on the\neffectiveness of GenAI in supporting architects by Tan and Luhrs [43] concluded that GenAI\nshows an encouraging potential for developing project briefs. In the early project brief\nstage, architects often rely on the client to clarify needs and expectations about the project\nand their experience of working in the field. This convergent thinking process, coupled\nwith information about projects in GenAI, assists in producing realistic and creative project\nbriefs. This kind of tool offers architects alternative design and rendering options that are\ncreative and time-efficient [43].\nDespite improved focus on sustainability in the design and execution phase of projects,\nit is argued that sustainable development goals (SDGs) could be better achieved when\nconsidered at a briefing stage, paving the way for design and execution that is well linked to\nsustainability outcomes. Regona et al. [38] identified the role of machine learning models in\nbrief development, which are targeted towards sustainable development goals—generating\ncompetitive, economically viable briefs, and improving project focus on sustainability [48].\n3.2. Architectural Design\nFigure 4 presents a thematic tree for architectural design, highlighting the role of GenAI\nin producing creative, quicker, and script-based designs. GenAI tools, such as Midjourney\nand Xcool, generate images based on users’ exploratory thinking and a set of keywords\nacting as scripts for design proposals. Generated imagery provides a cohesive overarching\ndesign idea that is used for a design project and forms the basis for successive design stages,\ncreatively and accurately [49,50]. Based on the project brief, GenAI tools offer schematic\ndrawings and useful ideas for elevations to be used for comprehensive architectural designs.\nThe availability of alternative design options based on the project brief and evolving clients’\nexpectations also assists in sound decisions for projects. This provides an opportunity\nfor architects to explore divergent and creative architectural designs. Marrone et al. [51]\nemphasise the collaboration between GenAI and humans to promote creativity and reduce\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n10 of 19\nthe time it takes to produce creative designs. Rafizadeh et al. [37] and Wang et al. [45]\nfind that automation using GenAI in architecture, engineering, and construction promises\nimproved design productivity, creativity, safety, and overall quality. Architectural form and\n3D models are often generated in tools like SketchUp and Revit when developing initial\ndesign. Having the opportunity to visualise multiple architectural forms in virtual space\ncould potentially benefit design decisions.\nDrogemuller et al. [27] used GenAI in conjunction with virtual reality technology to\ndevelop architectural designs, particularly architectural form generation, in a seamless\nprocess compared to the traditional design process. They tested versioning, iteration,\nmass customisation, and continuous differentiation in two small case studies to produce\nprogressively more complex architectural forms.\nIt is also crucial to recognise the issues related to the use of GenAI. Information gener-\nated by GenAI tools may lack project context, which could result in poor decisions. Creative\ntext-to-image GenAI tools may overlook other crucial design considerations, such as func-\ntionality, economic sustainability, and technical feasibility [37]. There is also a growing\nconcern about the protection of sensitive project information and intellectual property rights\nwith the increased use of GenAI in the design process [37] and the architectural design as\na product [35]. According to Perin [35], images generated by AI as architectural designs\nrefer to historically defined architectural elements, which defies the purpose of creativity\nand progress in architectural design practice. While encouraging the interrogation of the\nalgorithms used by GenAI in the architectural design productions, Perin is sceptical about\nthe positive contribution GenAI can bring to the professional design practice, not only\nwhen compared to the traditional architectural design processes, but also when compared\nto the pre-BIM computer-aided design presentation tools. Wang et al. [45] identify ethical\nchallenges, such as data fraud and privacy disclosure, as the main obstacles to realising the\nSDGs using GenAI.\n3.3. Structural Design\nFigure 5 presents a structural design thematic tree, and the literature points to the\nrole of GenAI in structural design generation, optimisation, and exporting outputs. The\nliterature points to improved results of structural design when GenAI tools are provided\nwith technical specifications about the design [7]. For example, Qin et al. [36] produced\na shear wall system design using a large language model (LLM) and GenAI in structural\ndesign. In their research, the shear wall design was generated and optimised in an iterative\nprocess, ensuring structural safety and cost-effectiveness, significantly reducing the design\noutcome’s material consumption and improving the design efficiency. Liao et al. [14]\nidentified the role of GenAI in design optimisation by learning from existing structural\ndesigns. Qin et al. [36] postulated a two-stage design optimisation method based on rules,\nsuch as material consumption and performance criteria. They pointed out that the design\ncan be exported to computer-aided design tools for subsequent modification, analysis, and\nverification. Rafizadeh et al. [37] also briefly mentioned the role of GenAI in structural\ndesign optimisation. The potential for GenAI tools in the structural design process heavily\nrelies on the specific type of tool and the technical design specification offered.\n3.4. Building Information Modelling\nFigure 6 presents a thematic tree for building information modelling (BIM), where\nopportunities and obstacles for GenAI in data integration have been identified. BIM has\nshown promising results, with a volume of research on BIM integration with other Industry\n4.0 technologies in AECO. However, the potential for GenAI together with Industry 4.0 is\nrarely discussed. Du et al. [28] prepared a literature review exploring the relationships\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n11 of 19\nbetween BIM and GenAI in the construction industry. They find that the ease of data\nintegration and conversion between BIM and GenAI tools is still in the early stages of\ndevelopment [28]. Part of the reason is that the compatibility of data and proprietary infor-\nmation is not always available to GenAI tools since most of the GenAI tools are not trained\non BIM information and rely on open-source data. There is an opportunity for construction\norganisations to train and adapt the GenAI tool available with commercial vendors to suit\nspecific business needs. This would essentially allow professionals to develop, update, and\nanalyse BIM models while adhering to professional codes and practices.\nIn a part of their research on digital twins (DT), Reja et al. [39] discussed the vast\nopportunities of DT to exchange geometric data to and from BIM. DT systems become\na reality when IoT devices, actuators, and sensors connect to BIM models, which can\nlive-transmit their readings to DT models. Information includes temperature, pressure,\nand performance metrics, among others. This capability further empowers the possibilities\nof BIM at different project stages to observe progress, simulate scenarios, and enable\nstakeholders to analyse ground-collected information details live on digital models, all\nwhile being physically distant from the site. This is also linked to Section 3.5. Construction\nand Demolition theme; when the live information is sent to DT, it enables remote site\nmonitoring and progress reporting.\n3.5. Construction and Demolition\nFigure 7 presents a thematic tree for construction and demolition, highlighting the\nrole of GenAI in planning and management, fabrication, demolition, waste, dispute pre-\nvention, and training. GenAI generates future scenarios (for example, risk assessments)\nthat help construction and site managers anticipate and respond to upcoming opportu-\nnities and problems, enabling sound decisions (risk mitigation). LLMS such as GPT-3\nhave been shown to allow for intuitive interactions and communication between project\nstakeholders and the DT of construction sites. Producing human-like text, LLMs facilitate\ninformation analysis, interpretation, and scenario propositions, which enables informed\ndecision-making [39]. Inherent in their development mechanisms, LLMs continuously learn\nand improve, which may contribute to further confidence in case-specific contexts and/or\nnon-traditional scenarios. This strategic thinking is cost- and time-effective compared to\ntraditional risk management methods, which heavily rely on the professional judgement of\nindividuals [52].\nGenAI has the potential to completely transform traditional construction practices by\ndrastically reducing material waste and expediting the construction schedule [4]. Material\nwaste in projects is often neglected and considered an unintended consequence of industry\npractices. When material waste management is prioritised using GenAI, it could offer an\nanalysis of existing resource allocation and the best course of action in given circumstances,\nleading to better management in accordance with the project schedule [4].\nSaad et al. [40] emphasised the role of GenAI in revolutionising materials in the\nbuilding industry. They argued that GenAI has tremendous potential, from creating more\ndurable substances to improving their performance, sustainability, and efficiency. GenAI\nopens up transformative fabrication possibilities that fundamentally alter how components\nare designed, manufactured, and assembled [4]. GenAI technologies have extended to\nquality control in steel fabrication processes, contributing to notable advancements in\nthe industry. For example, Civimec, an Australian fabrication company, have embraced\nAI-based computer vision systems to enhance quality control measures by detecting defects\nand deviations in steel components.\nLe Nguyen et al. [31] used optimisation methodologies in GenAI and machine learning\n(ML) to discover new concrete mixture designs that enhance strength and cost-efficiency,\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n12 of 19\nand reduce embodied CO2. The mix designs generated by the framework were success-\nfully validated through experimental tests, corroborating the predictive outcomes. The\nresults of their research led to the development of an open-access web application that\nenables construction industry stakeholders to optimise concrete mixture designs. Similarly,\nWang et al. [46] used GenAI to optimise engineered cementitious additives to enhance\nconcrete strength properties.\nFrom design to off-site fabrication and site works, construction processes can be\noptimised by leveraging machine learning algorithms, computer vision, and advanced\nrobotics [4]. Optimisation covers reducing greenhouse gas emissions, resources, waste, and\nassembly times while increasing quality. On-site assembly and installation with GenAI\nassistance is witnessing a paradigm shift, as it reduces labour, avoids human errors, and\nenhances rates of productivity and sustainability. Generating accurate descriptions would\nenable informed decision-making in infrastructure operations and safety. Ohueri et al. [33]\nand Dodampegama et al. [26] found that robots equipped with GenAI have the potential to\nprocess and interpret real-time data during building construction and demolition to sort\nwaste into reusable, recyclable, and non-recyclable materials. Ohueri et al. [33] focused on\nthe human–robot collaboration opportunities for training construction waste identification\nsensors. However, Dodampegama et al. [26] found that existing GenAI tools still lag\nin human–robot collaboration, especially with no publicly available construction and\ndemolition waste datasets to progress AI in real-life waste sorting tasks. Ohueri et al. [33]\nand Haris et al. [4] also expressed ethical and safety concerns that may result from the\noverreliance on robots in this field.\nShishehgarkhaneh et al. [41] found that the integration of advanced transformer-\nbased model technologies (such as BERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA) in the construction\nsector enhances its ability to navigate international market dynamics. This would enable\nmore resilient and responsive supply chain operations through timely risk identification\nand proactive management strategies. Wang et al. [45] and Regona et al. [38] found\nthat ChatGPT contributes to training workers for complex engineering projects. The\nimplementation of AI in construction management enhances safety, speed, accuracy, and\nefficiency of operations.\nTraining has become an important application of GenAI. Whether the training is for\nsafety [22] or company policy [4], GenAI tools can prepare appropriate materials and\ninformation in a structured manner to autonomously deliver induction sessions. These\nmaterials can be adapted to best suit the training objective, including but not limited to\nengaging, illustrative, and assessment-based content. Chen et al. [22] investigated the use\nof deep learning applications to boost situational safety awareness and work efficiency for\non-site workers and managers. Their research incorporated a simulation using augmented\nreality glasses on a construction site, which, despite the promising results, showed serious\nlimitations such as obstructing users’ field of view, causing distractions and fatigue resulting\nfrom long periods of use, and compromising focus on construction work tasks. While\nYazdi et al. [47] found that GenAI has revolutionised risk assessment by providing quick,\ncomprehensive, and pertinent evaluations, they recognised GenAI’s shortfalls and gaps\ncompared to human precision and contextual understanding in both construction sites\nand building operations. For instance, GenAI’s hazard identification accuracy and the\npracticality of its generated measures need refinement for buildings in operation. In an\nalarming finding, GenAI’s risk control measures are broad and found not to align with\nstatutory safety legislation. Overall, Yazdi et al. [47] acknowledged GenAI’s strengths\nin relevance and response times while highlighting areas such as accuracy, practicality,\ncredibility, clarity, and comprehensiveness where it could improve. AI demonstrates a\nreasonable level of contextual understanding, although it may excel in this area by learning.\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n13 of 19\nConcerning safety while operating heavy machinery, ChatGPT provides responses that\nare consistent with evidence-based guidelines in developed countries but are oversimplified.\nOviedo-Trespalacios et al. [34] found that while ChatGPT correctly provided advice on\nmitigating fatigue for those operating heavy machinery, the advice would only have\nbenefited if it were followed in its entirety. If the operator decides to pick and choose which\nrecommendation(s), they may end up with an intervention that leads to an inappropriate\n(insufficient) response to overcome fatigue safely. The research finds that information\ngenerated by GenAI tools on various safety topics may be limited, oversimplified, and\nmostly untraceable from reliable sources.\nWhile Gerber [30] recognised some of the powerful GenAI tools that can assist judges\nin drafting judgements, recalling procedural orders, and deciding construction dispute\ncases, GenAI cannot replace judges. GenAI still requires close supervision and close\nmonitoring of the system.\n3.6. Operations\nFigure 8 presents a thematic tree for operations. In building operations, Yazdi et al. [47]\nfound that GenAI has revolutionised risk management by providing quick, comprehensive,\nwell-organised, detailed, technically correct, and pertinent strategies when compared to\nrisk assessment generated by human experts. Comparatively, human responses were\nvague, broad, and followed a narrative style and needed more time to produce. The study\nsuggests that GenAI’s role in risk management is promising when complemented with\nhuman expertise and judgement using data-driven dashboards. These dashboards could\nenable real-time reporting and flag potential issues in building operations.\nSeveral authors see opportunities in using GenAI and machine learning to enhance\nthe efficacy of predictive building maintenance strategies [28,40,53]. They argue for lever-\naging the use of AI models to detect potential failures in building operations, such as\nlighting systems, thereby improving the user experience. Wahba et al. [44] pointed out the\ndevelopment of alternate models to improve thermal comfort prediction in the building\nrefurbishment process.\nIn HVAC system management for building operations, the IoT enables mass data\ncollection from smart devices of building users to enhance thermal comfort while reducing\nenergy consumption. With the objective of balancing indoor thermal comfort, air qual-\nity, and energy consumption, the integration of older generations of AI tools in thermal\ncomfort control systems has gained significant attention since the 1990s. Wahba et al. [44]\ninvestigated the use of innovative GenAI and LLM in HVAC’s thermal control to strike an\noptimum balance. Their systematic literature review finds that AI tools assist in interpreting\nand tracking data collected from HVAC control systems. Many research results enabled a\nsignificant reduction in energy consumption while maintaining acceptable thermal comfort.\nDespite recent advancements in the computational power of AI tools, Wahba et al. [44]\nfound that it is still limited in real-life applications due to a lack of understanding of the\nmodelling logic that GenAI uses.\nIn heritage buildings management and preservation, Spennemann [54] acknowledged\nthe values that five GenAI chatbots (namely ChatGPT 3.5, Bing Chat Balanced, Bing Chat\nCreative, DeepAI Genius, and Google Bard version 2023.07.13) provide in extracting and\nsynthesising extant and large-text information to recognise patterns and connections in\nthe design which could be ignored by human experts. Spennemann [42] finds that GenAI\noutput may still require human judgement for confirmation because some of these chatbots\nrely on less credible open-source data, which may not be reflective of the actual project\ncontext, heritage values, and authenticity. These issues could be better served by training\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n14 of 19\nGenAI models based on international heritage preservation guidelines and the historical\ncontext of the design.\n3.7. Urban Governance\nFigure 9 presents the urban governance thematic tree.\nIn urban governance,\nAlahi et al. [21] linked smart home automation and smart cities and urban governance.\nThey postulated that GenAI could collectively analyse the information harnessed from\nsmart homes to help in smart city planning. Considering energy consumption as an ex-\nample, peak operation hours favoured operation settings and endless opportunities to\nexplore and improve the ways domestic environments function more accurately. Fan\net al. [29] found that urban centres may optimise energy use and lower carbon emissions\nby combining AI algorithms with renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.\nThis will ensure ecologically friendly urban centres and lower energy prices for businesses\nand inhabitants. Smart urban centres may become more productive, efficient, and envi-\nronmentally sustainable by utilising these technologies, ultimately improving the living\nstandard for residents.\nGenAI has a wide range of possible uses in intelligent sensing and monitoring using\ndata analytics dashboards. AI-powered monitoring systems can improve public safety,\nstreamline traffic flow, and effectively control energy use in smart urban centres [4]. Math-\naraarachchi et al. [32] presented an approach for optimising GenAI chatbots to analyse\nlarge amounts of information gathered from sensors in energy infrastructure (IoT) to assist\nin urban-scale decision-making. The strategy aims to reduce carbon emissions from energy\ninfrastructure and was tested at the facilities of La Trobe University—a large, multi-campus\ntertiary education institution in Melbourne, Australia. The results highlight the effective-\nness of the proposed method in optimising GenAI chatbots towards net-zero emissions\nenergy IoT infrastructure.\nSeveral authors postulated the integration of GenAI in the built environment to achieve\nSDGs [29,38,45]. For instance, Wang et al. [45] emphasised on SDG11—sustainable cities\nand communities; SDG9—industry, innovation and infrastructure; and SDG12: responsible\nconsumption and production. LLM can facilitate the low-carbon energy transition in urban\nplanning and green infrastructure. Wang et al. [45] concluded that GenAI has the potential\nto contribute to most of the UN’s SDGs for a sustainable future. However, their research\nrecommended that such contributions must abide by regulatory frameworks to ensure\naccountability, safety and ethical procedures that address privacy.\nReja et al. [39] presented the advantages of using LLMs to analyse data collected from\nDT of cities and infrastructure using real-time IoT systems. Their review determines that\nwith the continuous evolution of GenAI’s decision-making abilities, the process starting\nwith data analytics up to decision-making in cities’ infrastructure could be independently\nhandled by GenAI. The extensive review by Cheng et al. [23] further breaks down the roles\nLLMs can play in a wide range of sustainable urban development applications. These\nroles are as a simulator, decision-maker, and expert advisor. The research finds that LLM\nhas excellent potential to simulate low-carbon power scenarios, carbon market dynamics,\nclimate risk assessments, and urban planning strategies. For example, in order to provide\nrecommendations for sustainable urban development to planners, LLM agents can model\nthe layouts, including parks, green spaces, and bike lanes, depending on environmental\nneeds and urban development goals. LLM can also operate power systems, integrate renew-\nable energy sources, predict demand patterns, and improve energy efficiency. Furthermore,\nLLM can provide expert advice in carbon accounting, satellite data interpretation, database\nmanagement, and sustainable supply chain management.\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n15 of 19\nZhang et al. [55] identified computational capabilities in conversational GenAI to assist\noperations of energy infrastructure towards net-zero carbon targets. Wu et al. [56] found\nthat GenAI creatively solve problems and optimises workflows in the urban planning\nproposals and the built environment industry. ChatGPT expedites writing, editing, and\nrefining reports on the built environment, such as heritage and environmental impact\nassessments. De Silva et al. [25] investigated Scene Graph Generation (SGG)’s ability to\ninterpret the volume of images of in-operation urban environments to enhance safety and\nefficiency for bicycle riders.\nIn smart city planning, Alahi et al. [21] examined the role of GenAI to analyse the\nvast amounts of data generated by IoT devices with accuracy and precision to aid decision-\nmaking. For example, public transportation, traffic lights, and citizens’ daily activities\ngenerate enormous amounts of data (e.g., traffic flow, air quality, and generated waste), and\nAI can identify insights that can increase the efficiency and productivity of municipal gov-\nernment operations (e.g., infrastructure maintenance), enhance sustainability, reduce costs,\nand help reduce human errors. In smart city planning, algorithms like machine learning,\ndeep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and\ngenetic algorithms can be used to analyse data, identify patterns, and produce projections\nbased on trends that people can understand. Among other things, these algorithms can\nimprove public safety, urban planning, and resource allocation. These algorithms are\nalso capable of predicting crime hotspots, analysing patterns of energy consumption, and\nforecasting traffic flow.\nOn the applications of GenAI in urbanism, urban living, governance, and planning,\nCugurullo et al. [24] expressed concerns on the increasing scale of AI dependency in\ncities to design, manage, and operate them instead of humans. For instance, the research\nperceives that a city run by AI, and not by humans, would challenge the autonomy of\nhuman stakeholders and struggle to be environmentally sustainable due to energy-intensive\nsupply chains. In this case, it is essential that human stakeholders retain high levels of\nautonomy to act and make decisions in situations and contexts where the logic of urban AI\ndeviates. Cugurullo et al. [24] were cynical about the social justice and equity of GenAI\napplications in urbanism, particularly in less democratic nations.\n4. Conclusions and Limitations\nGenAI is widely discussed in research related to the AECO. The literature holds an\noptimistic point of view of GenAI in AECO, which encourages development where needed.\nThe examples in this review suggest that GenAI does not necessarily give better solutions in\nall instances. It would be worthwhile collecting information on the veracity of the “advice”\nfrom Gen AI, and it may be possible to highlight those areas of excellence and other areas\nthat could be improved.\nGenAI’s applications in architectural design augment primary delivery outcomes,\ncreativity dimension, and other quality measures (for example, aiming for higher levels\nof sustainability objectives). The full potential of the integration of BIM designs and\nGenAI has not taken place yet, but early data exchange tools between the two hold great\npromise, particularly when it comes to enabling the full live monitoring of project progress\nand enhancing formative project management. The role of GenAI in building operations\nis undoubtedly growing, with significant attention to enhancing sustainable outcomes\nsuch as reducing energy consumption and optimising maintenance decisions. In urban\nmanagement, GenAI applications assist in guiding from higher-level decision-making\ndown to controlling traffic flow. The two most noticeable advancements in the use of GenAI\nare the amount of discussion on its role in achieving sustainable goals and its increasing\nautonomy in the decision-making process. The coverage of the use of GenAI in construction\nBuildings 2025, 15, 2270\n16 of 19\nand demolition holds the highest recognition, and accordingly, significant potential so far\nin the fields of construction site management, safety, training, contract administration, and\nwaste management.\nNonetheless, this systematic literature review found three main gaps in the literature.\nAlthough articles reviewed in this study confirm that GenAI are actively being used in the\nAECO industry, most articles are literature reviews and prescriptive and opinion-based\narticles. Few empirical studies have been undertaken to assess the impacts of generative\ntools in the AECO industry. This indicates that the application of GenAI in AECO is\nlimited. Most applications are still experimental and based on prospective benefits, which\nhave not been validated in a large-scale industry application. The second gap is that\nmost sectors covered in the analysed literature are construction and demolition, city and\nurban governance, and architectural design. The role of GenAI in the strategic definition\nand brief stage, in structural design, BIM, and in building operation is still understudied.\nThis is evident by the lower sub-theme levels identified under these core themes. Other\nintegral project stages and different project contexts have not been investigated and deserve\nattention, for example, different company and project sizes, contract types, cost planning\nand estimation, tender stages, project handover, geographical locations, and technology\nmaturity levels. It is worth noting that there is still less dedication to researching novel\ndomains in the AECO industries, reflecting the traditional culture of the construction\nindustry. Leadership from influential stakeholders is needed to embrace the adoption of\nthe latest technologies in the construction industry [57].\nLastly, no single author, publisher, or institute held a dominant position in the search\non GenAI applications in the AECO industry in the literature. The contributions were\nwidespread across various authors; outlined the diverse, explorative, and collaborative\nnature of existing efforts; and depicted a range of viewpoints and cumulative knowledge.\nWhile this may not be a gap, it indicates less dedication to researching this novel domain in\nthe AECO industries, at least compared to the more established fields.\n5. Future Research\nThis research shows that GenAI has brought transformative changes in AECO, but this\nhorizontal systematic literature review finds that there are very few empirical investigations\non the adoption of GenAI in the AECO industry. There is a pressing need to go beyond\nresearch reviews and examine views from the industry. Future research can collect and\nanalyse primary information from the AECO industry and professional bodies to better\nunderstand the way(s) GenAI is affecting their line of work, and the main challenges of\nusing it. First-hand information can also lead to comprehensively listing the common\nGenAI applications and programmes which are already in use in the AECO industries,\nand specifically at each of the project stages. Future works may prioritise professionals\ninvolved in understudied project stages (e.g., strategic definition and brief). Future research\nis expected to provide technical insights and cost–benefit analysis on the usefulness of the\nrapidly evolving field in AECO.\nAuthor Contributions: S.A.M.: conceptualisation, validation, resources, writing—review and editing,\nproject administration, and supervision.
